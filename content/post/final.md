## Final Project - paper folding machine

## Project Idea

I am currently planning to develop a modular paper airplane folding machine. I find this project intriguing and drew inspiration from a LEGO creation. I am contemplating the possibility of creating a modularized, faster, and more flexible paper folding device. Through the combination of various modules, it can fold (almost) anything.
