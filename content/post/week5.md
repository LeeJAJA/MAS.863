## Week5 - electronics design

### Assignment

individual assignment:</br>

- [x] use an EDA tool to design a development board to interact and communicate with an embedded microcontroller
- [x] extra credit: try another design workflow
- [ ] extra credit: design a case for it
- [ ] extra credit: simulate its operation

group assignment:</br>

- [x] use the test equipment in your lab to observe the operation of a microcontroller circuit board

## Group Assignment

Vincy and I attempted to use an oscilloscope to monitor the output of the analog pinout on a Xiao RP2040 microcontroller circuit board. We observed varying duty cycle changes.

We tried three different duty cycle percentages: 0%, 40%, and 80%.
