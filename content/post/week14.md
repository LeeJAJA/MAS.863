## Week13 - mechanical design

### Assignment

assignment:</br>

- [x]  Design and produce something with a digital fabrication process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it.

### Overview

I enrolled in a course focused on reverse engineering, where I learned to use CT scans and various tools to disassemble both familiar and unfamiliar components, aiming to deepen my understanding of their functionality.

This course includes multiple disassembly exercises of parts and components used throughout the program. These exercises are designed to enhance our comprehension of the mechanisms, strengths, and weaknesses of these components. Mastering the technique of teardowns (dismantling and reassembling objects to understand their workings) is a valuable skill. It serves as an effective initial step in exploring and learning about new technologies.
